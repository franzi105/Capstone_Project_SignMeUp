    "Signers who communicate using American Sign Language as their primary language were recruited from across the United States. They were shipped a Pixel 4a smartphone with an installed collection app. The app prompted the signer with the concept in English to sign, randomly selected from the 250-sign vocabulary. Signers pressed and held an on-screen button on the phone to record video while signing each concept, releasing the button after each sign. The video of the sign is extracted with a buffer 0.5 seconds before the press of the button and 0.5 seconds after the release of the button. This method of video collection matches the game interface where players touch the screen to aim a bubble and release the touch after they have finished signing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the app provided a video example of the sign desired, signers routinely made variants of the sign based on their background and region. More rarely, signers might fingerspell a sign, miss it completely, or produce the wrong sign. Extraneous movements, such as scratching an itch, or the ending movement from the previous sign or the onset of the next sign, are sometimes included. Conversely, some signers pressed the button late or released the button early, causing cropping in some sign examples. Some signers sign with their left hand; others sign with their right. Some signers switch their signing hand. All of these situations must be handled by the game’s recognition system.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the game includes 250 signs, it only needs to distinguish between five signs at a time due to the game design. Since accuracy increases as vocabulary decreases, even a recognition system with 60% accuracy on the 250-sign task should perform well when distinguishing between five signs."
